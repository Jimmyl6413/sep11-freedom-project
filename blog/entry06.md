Everyone's Freedom Project was a success and we've more to come next in our senior year! Now we are beginning to wrap things up and we will add our freedom projects to our portfolio soon!

## Content/Reflection

### In-Class Presentation
For my in class presentation I made a [google slides presentation](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1QYZshDa0u8TcL1wVMPX-fnKzLCCHWXbV0naMe0PFzkA/edit?slide=id.g35c4111360f_1_31#slide=id.g35c4111360f_1_31) which goes through my challenges, success, and the purpose of my project. I had many takeaways from my in class presentation like public speaking, eye contact, enthusiasm. Through this Freedom project I really feel like I've had a significant breakthrough with my public speaking skills as both my presentation in class and at the expo went surprisingly well. I feel like I am now better at presenting in front of a bigger crowd and the way I found that out was by practicing what I was gonna present. That gave me confidence when I was presenting as my mind was clear on what points I wanted to make and how I want to introduce these points to lead into the next points in my presentation. However, I do see a grow and another breakthrough I can achieve because towards the end of my presentation I struggled to grasp my audience attention with the takeaways and conclusion. I want to be able to have a more detailed explanation for my takeaways and ending of my presentation. But Overall this was a great breakthrough for me and it meant a lot. I also realized how Procrasination is a bad habit and not good for us as most of my peers struggled with procrasination throughout their Freedom project. Through Mr. Muller's feedback email I understood that I need to make more eye contact with my audience. The in class presentation was a great success and breakthrough for me and it gave my more motivation to do even better in the upcoming days, months, and years.

### Expo Elevator Pitch
During our Expo elevator pitch we had one minute to present what we made and the purpose of what we made in which I had many takeaways. I was unable to create and elevator pitch for the day of the presentation as I was overwhelmed with work and adding an BEYOND MVP onto my project. However, I was well prepared for this presentation as I practiced over and over again on the way to school. Takeaway's I had from this presentation is getting straight to the point, being open with challenges and ideas, and well explanations and understanding of the audience. These were all important takeaways for me because I only had one minute to present my project which meant I needed to get straight to my points as quickly as possible after I hook my audience onto my [game](https://jimmyl6413.github.io/sep11-freedom-project/tool/kaboom.html). 



## Engineering Design Process (EDP)
I am now in the last stage (stage 8) of the engineering design process. I will be communication the results of the SEP11 Freedom Project and reflect on both **grows** and **glows** that I have achieved throughout this year. Next I will add this Freedom Project Into my Portfolio.

## Skills
### Public Speaking
Through this Freedom project I really feel like I've had a significant breakthrough with my public speaking skills as both my presentation in class and at the expo went surprisingly well. I feel like I am now better at presenting in front of a bigger crowd and the way I found that out was by practicing what I was gonna present. That gave me confidence when I was presenting as my mind was clear on what points I wanted to make and how I want to introduce these points to lead into the next points in my presentation. However, I do see a grow and another breakthrough I can achieve because towards the end of my presentation I struggled to grasp my audience attention with the takeaways and conclusion. I want to be able to have a more detailed explanation for my takeaways and ending of my presentation. But Overall this was a great breakthrough for me and it meant a lot.

### Time Management
Managing my own time for the SEP11 Freedom Project was crucial because I had to make sure that I had enough time to finish my work for other classes and at the same time have time to tinker with my tool. Throughout this project I really struggled with time management as procrasination was my biggest obstacle which prevented me from efficiently using my time to do what I wanted to do. I would be like "I will start this assignment at 10 am and Complete it by 1 pm" but this was never the case as I use excuses like "5 more mins won't hurt". These 5 more mins build up overtime and the workload eventually becomes overwhelming. But at the end this really pushed me to develop this skill of managing time although it took a lot of discipline.

## Overview of the SEP11 Freedom Project
The SEP11 Freedom Project was an amazing year long project that really taught me a lot. This project brought me back to reality to realize that I need to try and strive harder in order to breakthrough. I really enjoyed this project and I am proud of what I was able to achieve dispite being at my lowest. I will continue to maintain this in every class I have and continue to strive harder than yesterday and tomorrow everyday.
