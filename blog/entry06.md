## Content/Reflection




## Engineering Design Process (EDP)
I am now in the last stage (stage 8) of the engineering design process. I will be communication the results of the SEP11 Freedom Project and reflect on both **grows** and **glows** that I have achieved throughout this year. Next I will add this Freedom Project Into my Portfolio.

## Skills
### Public Speaking
Through this Freedom project I really feel like I've had a significant breakthrough with my public speaking skills as both my presentation in class and at the expo went surprisingly well. I feel like I am now better at presenting in front of a bigger crowd and the way I found that out was by practicing what I was gonna present. That gave me confidence when I was presenting as my mind was clear on what points I wanted to make and how I want to introduce these points to lead into the next points in my presentation. However, I do see a grow and another breakthrough I can achieve because towards the end of my presentation I struggled to grasp my audience attention with the takeaways and conclusion. I want to be able to have a more detailed explanation for my takeaways and ending of my presentation. But Overall this was a great breakthrough for me and it meant a lot.

### Time Management
Managing my own time for the SEP11 Freedom Project was crucial because I had to make sure that I had enough time to finish my work for other classes and at the same time have time to tinker with my tool. Throughout this project I really struggled with time management as procrasination was my biggest obstacle which prevented me from efficiently using my time to do what I wanted to do. I would be like "I will start this assignment at 10 am and Complete it by 1 pm" but this was never the case as I use excuses like "5 more mins won't hurt". These 5 more mins build up overtime and the workload eventually becomes overwhelming. But at the end this really pushed me to develop this skill of managing time although it took a lot of discipline.

## Overview of the SEP11 Freedom Project
The SEP11 Freedom Project was an amazing year long project that really taught me a lot. This project brought me back to reality to realize that I need to try and strive harder in order to breakthrough. I really enjoyed this project and I am proud of what I was able to achieve dispite being at my lowest. I will continue to maintain this in every class I have and continue to strive harder than yesterday and tomorrow everyday.
