# Entry 1: Deciding a Tool and Tinkering with it to create a game (Pac-Man Game)
##### November 3, 2024

## Choosing my Tool & What Game I want to make
At first I chose to use [Kaboom](https://kaboomjs.com/) to make a game that was like flappy birds or an escape room. I tinkered with kaboom in my first learning log where I made an [html file](https://github.com/Jimmyl6413/sep11-freedom-project/blob/main/tool/kaboom.html) to help me tinker with Kaboom. I watched this [Youtube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hgReGsh5xVU&t=1088s) to help me get a good understanding of how different codes worked in kaboom. But as I was tinkering I found out that kaboom no longer updated their code which would make my life harder trying to code. So I decided to switch to [Phaser.io](https://phaser.io/) which is used to make 2D games. I came across pac-man which gave me lots of ideas and it was a 2D game. So I decided that I was gonna make my version of Pac-man for my Sep11 freedom project. I went on to create a [html file](https://github.com/Jimmyl6413/sep11-freedom-project/blob/main/tool/phaser.html) to tinker with phaser. I am still tinkering and working to figure out how it works.

## Engineering Design Process (EDP)
I am now in the first stage of the engineering design process. I will be deciding what I want to make for this years freedom project (Game, Website? etc) and choose a tool to help me make it. Next I will be approaching the second stage of the Engineering Design Process where we will be doing some research.
## Skills
### Time Management
Managing my own time in this part of the freedom project was crucial because I had to make sure that I had enough time to finish my work for other classes and at the same time have time to tinker with my tool.

### Searching for videos/tutorials and ways to tinker with my tool
 Searching for videos/tutorials and ways to tinker with my tool was a must have skill for this part of the Freedom project as I found many helpful tutorials on [youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oix_2NqrdRQ&list=PLHwEiwAgAA2Q3fjGRprbctl-fnOleF1q_&index=5) that helped me get a deeper understanding of kaboom js and Phaser js. At first I wanted to make a flappy bird sort of game with kaboom but soon found that code weren't being updated by kaboom any more so I switched to phaser.js where I found a new game that I wanted to make. I am now working towards on tinkering with phaser to hopefully make a pac-man like game by the end of the year.

### Being on Task
Being on task and maintaining focus is very important when it comes to finishing work on time. To help me maintian focus I like to be in a quite room with my phone or any distractions hidden away from my sight. Being able to maintain focus and finishing on task will do you a big favor after. It might feel tempting to just take a break and relax but trust me after You finish your work it feels 10x better relaxing. For this part of the Freedom Project is was very hard for me to stay on task and I often forgot to do work like my second learning log because there were work from other classes that were piling up. To help me stay on task in the future, I will be sure to not procrasinate and always keep a list of tasks that I have to finish on my phone.

## Next Steps
I am looking forward on continuing on tinkering with phaser.io and learning more about what we will get into next!
