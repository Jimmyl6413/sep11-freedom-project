---
### 9/30/2024:
* Created a [kaboom.html](kaboom.html) and installed kaboom using the CDN.
* Began practicing and testing out codes while watching tutorials on Kaboom js.
* Found basic tutorials on Kaboom js on youtube.
* Found a tutorial on making a [Flappy birds game](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hgReGsh5xVU).
* I feel like this tutorial will help me get a hang of how games are made with kaboom and how different concepts work in kaboom js.
### 10/6/2024:
* Began processing and trying to tinker with the Flappy Birds Tutorial video.
* Learned how to use and import sprites to my IDE.

### 10/12/2024:
* Ran into a problem that wasted 10 minutes of my time. When I tried importing the sprite, I typed spirte instead of sprite which was very hard to tell but thank god I remembered to look at the console to see what the problem was or else who knows how long it would of took me to realize.
* Importing sprites
* Learned how to make my sprites jump & move.
* Learned how to set gravity.

### 10/20/2024:
* Added a background img
* Added text to the game

### 11/4/24
* Switched to using [phaser.io](https://phaser.io/) since Kaboom js is no longer updating its code and I want to make a pac-man game.
* Imported phaser into a [html file](phaser.html) that I made for tinkering with phaser through CDN.

### 11/6/24
* Watched a [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oix_2NqrdRQ) tutorial on making a pac-man game.
* It has multiple parts to it and the first part requires downloading a external tool that helps with coding the structures of pac-man.

### 11/7/24
* Downloaded [tiled](https://www.mapeditor.org/download.html) which is a platform that helps create 2D like shapes for 2D games.
* I was unable to download it on school laptop as it was considered an "unsafe" platform.
* I downloaded it on my personal laptop which means I would have to code the 2D shapes into my project from home.

### 11/8/24
* Began testing out the codes that I saw from a variety of tutorials.
* This helped me see what different codes did and how they worked together.

### 11/18/24
* Started making my own custom tiles and structures on tiled.

### 11/21/24
* Ran into an issue with tiles.
* Need to download a file with the blue tile templates to import into tiled.

### 11/22/24
* Starting to make a custom map and basic structures.

### 12/5/24
* Downloaded the file with blue tiles and imported it to tiled.

### 12/7/24
* Began building and saved it in file as pacmantileset.json.
* Testing out different things in tiles to see how things work.
* Had a hard time understanding but figured it out eventually.

### 12/8/24
* Trying to figure out how I can import this to phaser.
