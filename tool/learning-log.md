### 9/30/2024:
* Created a [kaboom.html](kaboom.html) and installed kaboom using the CDN.
* Began practicing and testing out codes while watching tutorials on Kaboom js.
* Found basic tutorials on Kaboom js on youtube.
* Found a tutorial on making a [Flappy birds game](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hgReGsh5xVU).
* I feel like this tutorial will help me get a hang of how games are made with kaboom and how different concepts work in kaboom js.
### 10/6/2024:
